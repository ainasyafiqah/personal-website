              SPM, I got 4A's. For me, experience during middle school was the best because I get to know more people as I involved in a lot of competitions and 
              programs that the school have done before.

              have increases my circle of friends. It was such a good experience to study here and I'm planning on further my study in UiTM as well.

                <p>Next to it, is a photo of my whole family. My family consist of 6 members. I'm their first born.
                  There were 3 younger siblings under me. The second child is my little brother name Adam. The third child 
                  name is Athirah. The last child name is Afrina. For my parents, my mom's name is Sarifah and my dad's name is
                  Yussaini. Our age different are not too far away. Most of us are older or
                  younger by 2 or 3 years only. So, from left is my youngest sister, Afrina. Next to her is my dad, me, Adam,
                  my mom and Athirah. As the first born daughter, I have always love to take care of my younger siblings ever
                  since we were little kids. I'm very much grateful with the family that I got since day one. P/s: This picture was taken 
                  on my birthday last year (2021)

             <h2>IT ENDS WITH US</h2>
             <p>When I first encounter this book, it was actually recommended by a lot of book reviewers on TikTok.
                At first, the reviews that I have watched does not convince me enough. However, after seeing the reviews on goodread,
                I have decided to read them. I love physical book better than e-book version because I feel like it is much better
                having the book on my hand. I also wanted to increase my novels collections, hence I bought the book on book depository 
                website. It took about 2 weeks to arrive since it is pre-order book. The waiting was crucial for me since I was really impatient
                and I just can't wait to read the book. After it has arrived, I straight away read them. It took me about 4 days to finish the book 
                since the pages are average and not a lot for me. For me, I really like this book because it talks about abusive relationship whereby
                I think some of us can relate to. It is not unsual things in life but definitely not a good thing either. I just love how Lily face all of
                her marriage problems since she got an abusive husband. She used to lived in abusive household because of her father. She have witnessed
                all of the abuse that her mom have gotten from her dad ever since she was little. So, reading this book really open my eyes about abusive 
                relationship and not only romantic stuff. Life is definitely full of unexpected things just like how LIly never expected for her husband to be
                abusive after their marriage. This novel also talk about what you can do if you have ever encounter an abusive relationship. As a woman myself, 
                I think the Lily character is really inspiring. Hence, in my opinion the writer did a great job by talking about this issues even in her novels.
